# Dynamic-Frags
A sourcemod (https://github.com/Scags/Open-Fortress-Tools) plugin for Open Fortress that dynamically adds and removes from mp_fraglimit based on player count with many customizations 

License shit blah blah blah, just credit me if you edit and redistribute.

Plugin has an optional requirement for morecolors.inc which can be found here: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=185016

CVARS:
Cvar (possible states) (default state) description

*sm_dynamicfrags_enabled (0/1) (1) enables the plugin

*sm_dynamicfrags_multiplyer (>0) (3) how much to add to the frag limit per player

*sm_dynamicfrags_tv_on (0/1) (0) only exists because some reason trying to read from tv_on dirrectly brought the server to 5 tps.

*sm_dynamicfrags_playercap (>0) (8) any players that join after this ammount already have wont affect the frag limit

*sm_dynamic_frags_timecutoff (>1) (500) stops adding or removing to the limit after this amount of time in seconds has passed, set this to 0 to have it change regardless.
